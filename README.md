  1. npm install
  2. npm start - runs a local server
  3. npm test - runs the tests. [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) in the test runner

### Start server

a separate test server is bundled with the app. In the root of the server directory, > node server

I would like to acknowledge that I found an open source project that served as an example for me to learn from
in managing redux store. I used it s as model, borrowed and refactored code, but integrated it with my own
workflow and design elements
